  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Perfect little bite sized egg bites fused with hash brown and savory bacon</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Cooking Spray</li>
    <li>3 cups frozen shredded Hash Brown Potatoes</li>
    <li>3 tbsp Butter, melted</li>
    <li>1/8 tsp Salt</li>
    <li>1/8 tsp freshly ground Black Pepper</li>
    <li>2 cups shredded Mexican-style Four-Cheese blend</li>
    <li>6 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
    <li>1/4 cup chopped Red Bell Pepper</li>
    <li>6 slices of Bacon, crisp-cooked and chopped</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease 12 (2 1/2-inch) muffin cups with cooking spray.  </li>
    <li>Wrap hash browns in a clean kitchen towel and squeeze to remove as much moisture as possible. Stir together hash browns, melted butter, salt, and black pepper in a large bowl. Press about 1/4 cup of the hash brown mixture into bottom and up the sides of each prepared muffin cup.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 18 to 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, stir together cheese, eggs, bell pepper, and crushed red pepper (if using) in a bowl.</li>
    <li>Remove muffin tin from the oven. Reduce oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Top hash browns with half of the bacon. Top with egg mixture and remaining bacon. Bake until a knife inserted into centers comes out clean, 13 to 15 minutes. Garnish with chives. </li>
  </ol>
